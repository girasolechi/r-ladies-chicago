2020.02.26: Career Series Part I - Resumes in PageDown
================

## summary

Scarlett (<https://twitter.com/Scar_Data>) led us through an **awesome**
:fire: session on how to create a resume in Pagedown. Not only can we
create resumes quickly that show we know R, we can also use CSV files to
select for each version of the resume which items we want to include.
She’s saving us all from hours of resume updates for each unique
application\!

Scarlett is passionate about career advancement and just started her own
career consulting business\! Check out her announcement on Twitter to
learn more\! :clap:

## where to find the presentation

As always, the full presentation can be found by visiting the R Ladies
Chicago GitHub page (<https://github.com/rladies-chicago>).

## insights from the room where it happened

  - **Issue:** A few users who were newly installing Pagedown did not
    see the options for pagedown templates when they went to File - New
    File - R Markdown - From Template.
      - **Solution:** Restarting RStudio seemed to do the trick\!
  - **Wish List:** Many users wished there was a way to change the look
    and feel of the resume. Could we have different colors? Different
    icons? Somehow make a two-page resume?
      - **Wish (partially) Granted:** Google helped us find a few
        immediate needs. The resume template can be edited with CSS to
        solve some formatting needs such as in this example
        (<https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/issues/15>) and the
        fa-regular-400.svg file within the Pagedown install was found to
        hold the icon options for those who wanted to mix it up\! Much
        more to come in the future as this is a new package just
        introduce in 2019.
